## Conway's Game of Life in React

Welcome! This is a small/quick version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) made in React as a learning exercise. The user can click on a cell to toggle it, and hit the "Advance" button to move forward one tick.

### Coming Soon

If I work further on this, I'd like to add:
* Ability to determine size and wrapping behavior
* Preset patterns
* "Play" button to let the game keep running 

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can probably find the boilerplate README.md for that somewhere else.
