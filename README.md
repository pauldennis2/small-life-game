## Conway's Game of Life in React

Welcome! This is a small/quick version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) made in React as a learning exercise. The user can click on a cell to toggle it, and hit the "Advance" button to move forward one tick.

### Recently Added

* Ability to randomize the board`
* Play/pause button to make the game go

* Ability to control the rate

### Coming Soon

If I work further on this, I'd like to add:
* Ability to control the percent of cells turned on by randomization (roughly)
* Ability to determine size and wrapping behavior
* Preset patterns
* Toggle the grid & other cosmetic features
* Better UX (buttons disabled when not appropriate, etc)

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can probably find the boilerplate README.md for that somewhere else.
